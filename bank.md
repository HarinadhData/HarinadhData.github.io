# How I switched my career

The decision I made to switch from being a Civil Engineer to a Data Analyst was the most crucial one that affected my life. I am glad I took the initiative and made the effort to get to where I am today, despite the fact that the voyage wasn't without its difficulties. In my opinion, it's important to outline how I became interested in this subject, how I changed careers, how I overcame obstacles in my path, and what I am doing to advance in this sector.

When I observed my uncle utilizing data analytics to run his retail apparel business in India, I became interested in technology. He rose to the top in his community thanks to this extremely successful method. I was surprised at how he improved his business operations using data analytics ðŸ˜¯.

I worked for a reputable GMR group company ðŸ’¼ in the geospatial industry for four years. I acquired a great deal of technical skills and soft skills which gave me the capability to work with a prestigious stakeholder, which is the Survey of India. I served as the medium for my organization, which taught me valuable industry skills.

I took advantage of the opportunity to shift my career path internally and start a career in data analytics ðŸ“Šwhen I saw that my company had an opening for an analyst. I started by working with smaller datasets in Excel, then I used SQL to query larger datasets and Tableau to make aesthetically appealing charts and dashboards.

I decide to obtain a master's degree ðŸŽ“ to deepen my grasp of this field after accumulating enough work experience. I learned a great deal about databases, statistics, descriptive, prescriptive, and prescriptive modeling, as well as the R programming language.

In addition to this, I am completing capstone projects from the Google Data Analytics course and taking in-depth SQL, Excel, Tableau, Python, and R courses to round out my skills. Also, I'm releasing some projects and building a portfolio that will provide me with the necessary exposure to handle business issues in the real world.

These technical talents, coupled with the numerous soft skills I acquired while working for the organization, are crucial to my success today and will serve as a strong basis for my future as a data analyst, in my opinion.

I love reading crime thrillers while traveling the world. I have traveled across India and some places in the U.S. I wish to travel the US in an RV. Applications Accepted!ðŸ˜€

I would be glad to connect with people who are passionate about the field of Data Analytics.
